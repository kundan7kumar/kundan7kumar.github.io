My research interests span across the fields of machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on autonomous systems such as self-driving cars, drones, smart grids and Medical AI. My work aims to enhance the explainability of model behavior and increase awareness of predictive uncertainty.

**Research Topic:**
Reinforcement learning, a sub-field of machine learning, addresses sequential decision problems through trial-and-error. It involves an agent interacting with an unknown environment, learning from its experiences to maximize a reward function. The agent builds its own database online based on the decisions it makes. Reinforcement learning is vital for real-world optimization problems, including robotics, data center control, and traffic light control. It also simulates animal and human learning processes, presenting a potential path towards achieving artificial general intelligence.

In addition to traditional approaches, my research incorporates Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models. GPT, with its ability to understand and generate human-like text, adds a dimension of natural language processing to reinforcement learning. This integration aims to enhance the communication and interpretability of reinforcement learning models.
