My interests broadly lie in the fields of machine learning, Bayesian statistics, and artificial intelligence.
I am interested in autonomous Systems like self driving cars, drones and Medical AI. It helps in explanations of model behavior and are made aware of predictive uncertainty.

**Research Topic:**
Reinforcement learning is a sub-field of machine learning that focuses on solving sequential decision problems through trial-and-error. It involves an agent interacting with an unknown environment and learning from its own experiences to maximize a reward function. Unlike supervised or unsupervised learning, the agent builds its own database online based on the decisions it makes. The reward function in reinforcement learning is often less informative compared to supervised learning, and it does not necessarily need to be differentiable.

This field is particularly interesting for solving real-world optimization problems that require making a series of interconnected decisions, such as robotics, data center control, and traffic light control. Additionally, reinforcement learning can be viewed as a simulation of animal and human learning processes, making it a potential avenue towards achieving artificial general intelligence.
