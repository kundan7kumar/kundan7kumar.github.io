Hey there!

I am a Ph.D. student in the [Computer Science](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/) & Ph.D minor in [Statistics](https://www.stat.iastate.edu) at the [Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/), where I am supervised by [Tichakorn Wongpiromsarn](https://tichakorn.dev/). My research interests lie in statistical machine learning, artificial intelligence, and self driving cars.

I think that i was too lethargic in my life, there is no fun in my life. I started chaning my motoncity in my life.

Heath is a state of complete harmony of the body, mind and spirit
by Iyenger
I started a small steps in this regards. Thanks

Upon moving to the United Kingdom in Fall 2019, I decided that I wanted to *attempt* to visit every country in Europe before I finish my Ph.D. I will keep a running list of countries here (along with the date and city I first visit):

1. Denmark: March 5, 2020. (Copenhagen with HP)
1. Spain: January 25, 2020. (Barcelona for FAT\* 2020)
1. Monaco: January 10, 2020. (Monaco with DS and SS)
1. France: January 9, 2020. (Nice with DS and SS)
1. United Kingdom: April 1, 2019. (London to see AW)
