Upon moving to the United Kingdom in Fall 2019, I decided that I wanted to *attempt* to visit every country in Europe before I finish my Ph.D. I will keep a running list of countries here (along with the date and city I first visit):

1. Denmark: March 5, 2020. (Copenhagen with HP)
1. Spain: January 25, 2020. (Barcelona for FAT\* 2020)
1. Monaco: January 10, 2020. (Monaco with DS and SS)
1. France: January 9, 2020. (Nice with DS and SS)
1. United Kingdom: April 1, 2019. (London to see AW)
